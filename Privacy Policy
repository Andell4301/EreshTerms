Privacy Policy

Updated 10/17/2022

The only type of user data EreshBot (the “Bot”) collects is friend codes submitted via the /setrayshift command and relevant 
settings submitted with the use of the command. Friend codes submitted to the Bot should be considered publicly available for anyone to see, 
regardless of the use of the “Private” option. 

You can delete saved friend codes by using the /setrayshift command again with “remove” as the friend code. 
Doing so immediately and permanently deletes saved friend codes for the specified region.
